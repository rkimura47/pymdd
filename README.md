# pymdd
A simple Python implementation of a multivalued decision diagram (MDD), for use in optimization.

# Installation
1. Create a new directory named `pymdd/` in your working directory.
2. Create a copy of `mdd.py` in `pymdd/`.
3. If you using Python 2, create an empty file called `__init__.py` in `pymdd/`
    (this ensures that python will recognize `mdd.py` as a module).

# Usage
After following the installation instructions, you can now import the module from your working directory by calling
```python
from pymdd.mdd import *
```

The `examples/` directory includes some sample scripts based on examples from the book *Decision Diagrams for Optimization* by Bergman, Cire, van Hoeve, and Hooker (Springer, 2016).
