# pymdd
A simple Python implementation of a multivalued decision diagram (MDD), for use in optimization. The code prioritizes transparency over speed so that the user can clearly see the effects of various operations performed by the MDD.

At present, it can do the following:

* Compile an exact MDD given a dynamic programming (DP) formulation of the problem.
* Compile a relaxed or reduced MDD given a DP formulation of the problem and node selection/merging rules.
* Compile an exact MDD representation (with canonical arc costs) given a list of paths and their corresponding weights.
* Filter and refine an existing MDD for a constraint given as a DP model.
* Perform a shortest/longest path computation over the MDD.
* Write the MDD to a [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org) file for visualization.
* Save/load the MDD to a JSON file for archiving/reconstruction.

# Installation
To install for all users, navigate to root directory and call
```python
pip install .
```
If you only want to install locally, use [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (Python 3 only). Alternatively, you can perform the following steps manually:
1. Create a new directory named `pymdd/` in your working directory.
2. Create a copy of `mdd.py` in `pymdd/`.
3. If you using Python 2, create an empty file called `__init__.py` in `pymdd/`
    (this ensures that python will recognize `mdd.py` as a module).

# Usage
After following the installation instructions, you can now import the module from your working directory by calling
```python
from pymdd.mdd import *
```

The `examples/` directory includes some sample scripts based on examples from the book [*Decision Diagrams for Optimization* by Bergman, Cire, van Hoeve, and Hooker (Springer, 2016)](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319428475).
