# pymdd
A simple Python implementation of a multivalued decision diagram (MDD), for use in optimization. At present, it can do the following:

* Compile an exact MDD given a dynamic programming (DP) formulation of the problem.
* Compile a relaxed or reduced MDD given a DP formulation of the problem and node selection/merging rules.
* Filter and refine an existing MDD for a constraint given as a DP model.
* Perform a shortest/longest path computation over the MDD.
* Write the resulting MDD to a [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org) file for visualization.

# Installation
1. Create a new directory named `pymdd/` in your working directory.
2. Create a copy of `mdd.py` in `pymdd/`.
3. If you using Python 2, create an empty file called `__init__.py` in `pymdd/`
    (this ensures that python will recognize `mdd.py` as a module).

# Usage
After following the installation instructions, you can now import the module from your working directory by calling
```python
from pymdd.mdd import *
```

The `examples/` directory includes some sample scripts based on examples from the book [*Decision Diagrams for Optimization* by Bergman, Cire, van Hoeve, and Hooker (Springer, 2016)](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319428475).
